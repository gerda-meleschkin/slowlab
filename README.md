# Solar oven  by the Slow Lab
### by Gerda Meleschkin and Audrey Belliot

This is the documentation of our process of design and fabrication of a solar oven for FabAcademy microchallenge #1


## Concept & purpose
Our research and areas of interest are about "slowing down" our way of life, promoting a resilient lifestyle and bring more awareness.
<br>In that context, we already started experimenting with different low techs related to food (production or preparation).
<br>For this first challenge, we decided to continue in that direction and create a **solar oven**. Not just an object dedicated to camping or emergency situations, we would like to see it in our kitchens as an appliance for everyday life.

## Planning
- Day 1 : Kick-off of the challenge on Wednesday 16th. Brainstorming, inspiration by analyzing the various existing techniques for solar ovens, simulation of the sun beams and their reflection.
- Day 2 : Sketching the solution.<br> Separation of the tasks for the 2D design : Gerda designed the inside part with the reflecting panels and Audrey the outside box. <br>Laser cutting the inside part and vinyl cutting the reflecting panels. 
- Day 3 : Laser cutting the outside box.

## Final Solar Oven


## Test in the sun


## Material needed
- MDF or plywood for the inside and outside parts (size)
- Rope for the extension of the panels
- Foil paper or emergency blanket for the reflecting panels


## Future development opportunities
- cooking experiment with the oven & measure the temperature inside & outside of the oven at the same time.
