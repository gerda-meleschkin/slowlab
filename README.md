# Solar oven  by the Slow Lab
### by Gerda Meleschkin and Audrey Belliot

This is the documentation of our process of design and fabrication of a solar oven for FabAcademy microchallenge #1


## Concept & purpose
Our research and areas of interest are about "slowing down" our way of life, promoting a resilient lifestyle and bring more awareness.
<br>In that context, we already started experimenting with different low techs related to food (production or preparation).
<br>For this first challenge, we decided to continue in that direction and create a **solar oven**. Not just an object dedicated to camping or emergency situations, we would like to see it in our kitchens as an appliance for everyday life.

## Planning
- Day 1 : Kick-off of the challenge on Wednesday 16th. Brainstorming, inspiration by analyzing the various existing techniques for solar ovens, simulation of the sun beams and their reflection.
- Day 2 : Sketching the solution.<br> Separation of the tasks for the 2D design : Gerda designed the inside part with the reflecting panels and Audrey the outside box. <br>Laser cutting the inside part and vinyl cutting the reflecting panels. 
- Day 3 : Laser cutting the outside box.

## Fabrication process
### Lasercutting 

We created 4 different parametric designs: The outer box, the inner box, two big rules and 8 small one. We used different kind  of techniques like press fit and kerf bending.

- Power : 60
- Speed: 0.5
- Frequency: 1000

### Vinyl cutter

It was the first time we used the method cutting parts with the vinyl cutter, so we wanted to implemend it into our design. We tried first cutting an emergeny blanket, but this material is very fragile and thin. So we could cut it with an extra sticky board, but after removing it it broked very fast. So we wanted to find another material which we could laser cut, so one sight has to be not reflective, but the we figured out that we cannot laser the foam. So we tried to cut the foam with th vinyl cutter and it worked pretty good! Also when cutting letters it worked very exact.

## Material needed
- MDF or plywood for the inside and outside parts (size)
- Rope for the extension of the panels
- Foil paper or emergency blanket for the reflecting panels

<br>

## Future development opportunities
- Improve the design to find the perfect angle to maximize temperature
- Experiment cooking with the oven & measure the temperature inside & outside of the oven at the same time.
