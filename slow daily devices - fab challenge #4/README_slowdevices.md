## Concept & purpose

### Slow Lab
We want to explore ways in which we can live a more resilient lifestyle and try to implement systems that are less dependent on fossil fuel energy. By approaching this subject we started experimenting with a Solar Oven to see if you could use the energy of the Sun to heat up our food instead of the usual microwave or oven. With this we try to start a slow movement in which we bring awareness to our everyday habits and embrace a slower pace with processes. This will pave the way to enjoy more the moment and eliminate the rush of our daily activities by giving time for things to transform.

### Challenge 4
For this challenge, we decided to work on a collection of artefacts that can be part of the "slow" and low tech daily routines we want to promote.

* Paula Solar energy:
  - Small version of a solar oven to attach to any window and that rotates to follow the sun

* Gerda Human energy:
  - Generator of electricity on the bike to power a device

* Audrey Human energy:
  - Bike generator (static bike) for homes to power 12-24V devices at 175-350W

* Audrey bottle cooler:
  - Clay printed wine cooler to refresh bottles using the principle of evaporation

* Data collection:
  - Live data: collect live data from the previous devices to control efficiency
  - Ad hoc analysis: collect data on a SD card from the sensors used on these devices to be able to create graphs or other data visualization and see efficiency levels.


## Planning
We separated the tasks between us based on our interests and on the skills we wanted to work on during the challenge:
* Gerda worked on the "mobile" bike generator with the dynamo
* Paula on the rotating stand for solar ovens (or other devices that need to follow the sun)
* Audrey on the clay printed wine cooler and the home bike generator

We decided to focus on these devices first and work on the data collection at the end if we had some extra time.

## Fabrication process

### Clay wine cooler
Steps:
    - Make a design on Rhino for a simple “vase” shape without thickness
    <br>Notes:
    Size limitations to take into account: printer plate 20x20 / kiln 20x20x15 height
    <br>The size will reduce of about 10-15% after cooking
    - Measurements : perimeter wine bottle 23-24 cm / diametre 8 cm → I will leave around 2-3 cm for water around the bottle so the wine cooler can be 13 cm diameter. + If it reduces of 10-15% when cooking I need to do it 15 cm diameter
    - In Grasshopper, I created a cylinder and a circle with the same center point and radius and merged them.
    - I "baked" the shape and opened the file with gcode for the paster printer slicer
    - Use the  latest version of the Grasshopper file to generate the gcode
    - Open the software "Repetier", connect it to the Ender printer and check the "z" value when we add a base. Then change this value in the Grasshopper setup.
    - Copy the Grasshopper code into Repetier

- Preparing the machine.

    - Launch the print
During the print it is important to stay close to the printer to adjust the pre


- Let dry for at least 2 days, cook and increase the temperature every hour, let cool down during the night
