## Concept & purpose

### Slow Lab
We want to explore ways in which we can live a more resilient lifestyle and try to implement systems that are less dependent on fossil fuel energy. By approaching this subject we started experimenting with a Solar Oven to see if you could use the energy of the Sun to heat up our food instead of the usual microwave or oven. With this we try to start a slow movement in which we bring awareness to our everyday habits and embrace a slower pace with processes. This will pave the way to enjoy more the moment and eliminate the rush of our daily activities by giving time for things to transform.

### Challenge 4
For this challenge, we decided to work on a collection of artefacts that can be part of the "slow" and low tech daily routines we want to promote.

* Human energy:
  - Generator of electricity on the bike to power a low tech navigating system
  - Bike generator (static bike) for homes to power 12-24V devices at 175-350W

* Solar energy:
  - Small version of a solar oven to attach to any window and that rotates to follow the sun
  - Clay printed wine cooler to refresh bottles using the principle of evaporation

* Data collection:
  - Live data: collect live data from the previous devices to control efficiency
  - Ad hoc analysis: collect data on a SD card from the sensors used on these devices to be able to create graphs or other data visualization and see efficiency levels.
